Working with subject matter experts (SMEs) is a crucial element in technical writing. Even though I start out by reviewing project specifications and test out workflows myself in the system and do everything in my power to familiarize myself with the product I'm writing for, at a minimum, I still rely on the SME to review my text for correctness and completeness. 
However, depending on various factors like timing, workload, or past conflicts with previous writers, collaborating with SMEs can be challenging. However, through trial and error, I've developed techniques that help me build mutually beneficial relationships with SMEs. To help define my techniques, I've divided the SMEs into five main categories:
*	The Ghost
*	The Waffler
*	The Grammar Expert
*	The Collaborator

# The Contradictor
Starting off with one of the more tough types, this SME appears to be against all documentation. They typically are resistant to providing feedback, can come across as hostile, and tend to make disparaging comments around the documentation in general. In my experience, this attitude is paired with a misunderstanding of documentation goals and sometimes a bad experience with a previous technical writer. 
So to build this relationship, you need to demonstrate the value of the documentation and prove that you bring value to the project as a writer. To help showcase the value you bring, ensure that you spend a little extra time looking up any processes, style rules, or other written guidelines that back up any changes you made or are requesting before you contact them. The contradictor is going to question your expertise, so it is up to you to prove that you know your area to gain respect. 
Another tip I've found to be particularly helpful is to mentally approach the conversations as if the person is already a long-time friend. When you walk into a meeting steeling yourself for an argument, it typically shows in your body language, tone of voice, and word choice. When I shift my mindset to think of the person as a friend, it allows me to laugh at snarky comments, joke back, and show myself as an accessible person. This has also helped me develop real friendships with people, which creates a foundation you can educate from and build on together. 

# The Ghost

If you can look around and see proof that your SME has been here, but you never actually see or hear from them, you may be working with a ghost. This SME is usually someone who is extremely busy and likely overworked. They are juggling several priorities and your documentation never seems to make it to the top of their list. Again, this is a tough SME to work with, but if you respect their time and position your communication appropriately, you can usually develop a working relationship that meets your needs.
First, I'd recommend that you take a step back and look at the documentation process you're working under. Consider when you've been reaching out to the SME, when (if ever) you hear from them, and when the due date is. After considering the history, identify process changes. Ask other members of the team if meetings, scrums, or demos are happening that you can attend. See if you can gain any additional information from the project tracking program. Do everything you can to get the information you need without creating an extra touchpoint for your SME. 
After you have done the prep work above and identified the best time to reach your SME, ensure that your message is as concise as possible without needing to send follow-up questions. Additionally, if you're using a program that allows headings, add text such as "Decision Needed by [Date]:" or "Action Required by [Date]:" to the heading to help them understand that the message has a priority. 
Also consider sending a meeting to discuss the email the day before the response is due, and attach the sent email to the message. Sometimes the SME will respond to the email in advance of the meeting to avoid it altogether, and if not, you can easily access the questions and get answers by the due date.

# The Waffler
If your SME informally approves a page, then rejects a more formal approval or comes back to make more changes, then rejects a formal approval again, and this cycle seems to repeat itself, you may have a waffler on your hands. This SME is great because clearly they are reading and care about the content you produce, but it can be frustrating and time consuming to constantly circle back to a topic that should already be complete. 
If you have noticed this trend, I'd recommend the following techniques to streamline the process:
*	See if you can identify any common points of indecision - are they concerned about a specific topic? Do they want to add descriptive text? Are they documenting alternative workflows? Note common areas of concern.
*	Set up more touch points in the documentation process, from viewing demos to reading project tool correspondence to an extra meeting with the SME to discuss their top priorities for the documentation.
*	Ask for any workflow and process diagrams you can get your hands on, and request that they send any updated diagrams your way as soon as possible. 
*	Work with the SME to clearly identify your audience.
*	Instead of sending a document for email approval, set up a meeting to walk through it and discuss any decisions you've made. This is a good time to consider the first bullet point above and proactively discuss why you made decisions within the context of common concerns.
*	If possible, finalize the content and receive final approval during the meeting.

# The Grammar Expert
One of the funnier memories I have is from when I was a newer technical writer and I sent a page for approval...only to have the SME make several grammar, punctuation, and even spelling edits before sending it back to me. I was very confused, because I wanted them to review the content but they got distracted by the mechanics. 
While it can be difficult to view this as a positive, it actually can be. However, it's also important that the SME is reviewing the content for accuracy rather than spelling, so when met with this type of SME I complete the following actions on the very first document I receive:
*	Review their edits to see if any of them have merit. Are their sentences shorter? Longer? What type of changes have they made? Do they improve the content for the audience? If some of the changes improved the documentation - I take note and learn from it to become a better writer. 
*	List out the edits they made that are incorrect, and indicate the reasons why I am reverting back to original content, ensuring that I refer to specific style entries or process information as applicable. 
*	Have a call or quick in-person meeting to talk through the changes I accepted and reverted, thank them for work done so far, and ask for a review of the content. 
*	Send an email describing the changes you reverted as well. 

The in person or phone element is important here, because you can smile and they can hear from your voice or see from your face that you're not pushing back in anger. As we all know, it can be hard for someone to reject your writing, and you want to avoid alienating this person and turning them into a contradictor.
When I send future content their way for review, I indicate that I'm looking for a review of the content, but that they are welcome to let me know if they think they see any other issues. And if they make non-content-related edits, I go back through and identify areas to learn and spell out reasons I reverted text and send them the information again - but now over text.
For some SMEs, I've had to delve into grammar mechanics and re-educate myself on the specifics when explaining why I will not make some of their changes when they push back on reversions, but honestly it helped firm my English knowledge. Also, educating them helped streamline our interactions and improve their knowledge as well. It can be really nice to have an additional editor on your side after you've trained them up on the style guide and processes! Just ensure that they also focus on the content review as well, because that is their most important task when reviewing.

# The Collaborator

This is always my end goal for the SMEs I work with. A collaborator is SME who works with you efficiently to meet deadlines. You have a professional working relationship and mutual respect. Depending on where you started, you may use a variety of techniques I mentioned above when maintaining the relationship, but you are able to talk openly and they respond as needed, make decisions and publish in an appropriate time-frame, and respect that you are the expert on documentation. 

You'll notice that in all categories above, I emphasize understanding where the SME is coming from. I think in any relationship in life, empathy is important. People have many motivations, and understanding where someone is starting from can help you meet them where they are at to grow a healthy working relationship.
What are your thoughts? Do you have any issues you'd like crowdsourced ideas for?
