The four sets of guidelines or styles are commonly considered when a writer is instructed to write clear and accessible text: Plain Language, Simplified English, localizable content, and Global English. In the sections below, I'll spell out some key differences.

#Plain Language
Plain Language (PlainLanguage.gov) is a set of guidelines that promote the use of simple and clear language to help readers quickly understand the text. It is a basic guide that provides a good starting point for writing clear and concise content. However, it may not be restrictive enough for larger teams who write for the same product and require consistency.

#Simplified English
Simplified English is a controlled language that limits the dictionary you are allowed to use words from. It is most useful for text that is written but not translated for non-Native English speakers. The idea behind it is to teach users a smaller subset of words (the official ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English dictionary includes only 860 general words) so that the users can interact with the content more quickly and spend more time doing the task they are trying to complete. Simplified English shares many guidelines with Plain Language in its drive for simplicity.

#Localizable content
Localizable content is text that is created with the knowledge that it will be translated, typically by human translators. It is important to avoid ambiguous word choice and sentence structures that will not translate well and to add notes for clarity. Most Plain Language is localizable, and the concepts of clear and simple language apply to it as well.

#Global English
Global English is a style of writing that aims to use a universal language that is easily understood by non-native speakers while sounding natural to native speakers by focusing on the following core elements:
* Use logical, literal, precise wording 
* Focus on simplicity and clarity by using more easily understood sentence and grammatical structures

It allows for the full use of the dictionary with stipulations on what to avoid. It tends to include everything from the Plain Language guide but provides specific guidance and examples. Its guidelines intend to improve the localizable content as well.  

#In Favor of Global English
In college, my teacher spoke about Global English as though it was the up and coming style guide of the future, or at the very least that it would be a major selling point on resumes. I haven't heard Global English mentioned once since I left her class over a decade ago. However, As time has passed, I’ve seen people add more and more global-minded rules to the extensive company-specific style guide I work with today. And in past jobs, these same rules seemed to creep into their style guides too. I have to admit that going through my textbook on Global English from college to refresh myself on the rules to write this post, I’m gaining insight into why I write some things the way I do.

The extensive style guide covers grammar, punctuation, vocabulary basics, and flow - all of which are tied to the basic tenets of making your text clear and concise. Take a look at the following sampling of rules from The Global English Style Guide: Writing Clear, Translatable Documentation for a Global Market by John R. Kohl:
* Use nouns as nouns, verbs as verbs, and so on
* Don’t use transitive verbs intransitively, or vice versa
* Limit the length of sentences
* Use a verb-centered writing style
* Limit your use of passive voice 
* Use complete sentences to introduce lists
* Clarify what each prepositional phrase is modifying
* Don’t use this, that, these, and those 
* Use that in relative clauses

Do they look familiar? I know we are slowly adding more and more rules to aid in global readership and translation, So does it make sense to continue incorporating these rules into proprietary style guides? Or would adding a Global English style guide as a comprehensive supplementary guide be more beneficial? Constant global communication isn’t phased remotely (pun intended) by borders anymore, and the following groups of people likely account for more of our reader base than we are aware of:
* People who speak English as a second language
* Translators (both human and machine) who work hard to make content accessible
* People who are functionally illiterate^1^

Because I have not heard this style guide or concept referenced in a long time - I want to discuss it! Have you heard of it before - possibly under a different name? Tell me all about your thoughts on it in the comments below!
